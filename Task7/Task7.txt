Define a function with the header:
const Couple* bestClient(const Couple* cpls, int size, Banks bank);
This function returns a pointer to the couple in the array passed as the first argument 
(with dimension size) that has the largest sum of their (his) and her savings, but only among such couples 
where at least one of the partners has an account in the bank bank. If none of the people have an account in the bank bank, the function returns nullptr. 
It is not assumed that the account balance is non-negative; it can be arbitrarily large positive or arbitrarily large negative. 
If two or more couples among those that meet the imposed condition have the same, largest savings, the function returns a pointer to any of them.
