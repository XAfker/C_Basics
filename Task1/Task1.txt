Write a program that reads in integers until a zero appears and prints out the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers with the same value (and that value).
For example, for
22 22 22 22 3 3 3 2 -6 -6 -6 0
the result should be
Longest sequence: 4 times 22
for
-2 -2 -2 31 31 31 31 31 17 6 6 6 0
the result should be
Longest sequence: 5 times 31
and for
-3 2 -3 -3 2 -3 61 61 61 0
it should be
Longest sequence: 3 times 61
Do not use arrays, strings, or any other collections
