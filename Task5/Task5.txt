We are conducting a survey on a given topic. The result of a single survey (obtained from one respondent) contains the following information that should be encoded in a single unsigned short variable (it can be assumed that it has 2 bytes, i.e. 16 bits):

gender - 1 bit, because 2 possibilities (woman, man), coded as 0 or 1;
marital status - 2 bits, because 4 possibilities (single/bachelor, married/wife, divorced/divorcee, widow/widower) coded as 0, 1, 2 or 3;
age group - 2 bits, because 4 possibilities (e.g. 18-30, 31-45, 46-60, 60+) coded as 0, 1, 2 or 3;
education - 2 bits, because 4 possibilities (e.g. basic, secondary, bachelor's degree, master's degree+) coded as 0, 1, 2 or 3;
place of residence - 2 bits, because 4 possibilities (e.g. village, city up to 50 thousand, city 50-400 thousand, city over 400 thousand inhabitants) coded as 0, 1, 2 or 3;
region of the country - 4 bits, because (let's assume) there are 16 regions numbered from 0 to 15;
answer to the survey question - 3 bits, because in the survey (let's assume) there were 8 possible answers, numbered from 0 to 7.
Write the function
unsigned short koduj(int plec, int stan_cyw,
int grupa_wiek, int edu,
int zam, int region,
int odp);
that takes 7 numbers (as above), encodes the information contained in them in a single unsigned short variable and returns that one number to the calling function.
Also write the function
void info(unsigned short kod);
that takes a single unsigned short argument containing information about a single survey and prints out this information, e.g. in the form:
gender: 0
marital status: 3
age group: 2
education: 3
place of res.: 0
region: 12
answer: 6
Do not create any arrays or strings. Use only bit operations (ANDing, ORing, bit shifting. . .).
